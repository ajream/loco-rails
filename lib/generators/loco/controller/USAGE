Description:
    Stubs out a new controller. Pass the controller name under_scored
    and a list of methods as arguments.

    To create a controller within a namespace, specify the controller name as
    a path like 'namespace/controller_name'. It will also generate a namespace
    controller.

    This generates a controller class in app/assets/javascripts/controllers.

Example:
    rails generate loco:controller admin/articles index show destroy

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/controllers/admin.coffee
        app/assets/javascripts/controllers/admin/articles.coffee
