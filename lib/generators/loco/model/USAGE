Description:
    Stubs out a new model. Pass the model name under_scored (as you would like to name the file)
    and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are name:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    If you pass a namespaced model name (e.g. admin/account)
    then the generator will create file inside specified path with namespaced
    class name (e.g App.Models.Admin.Account).

    Attribute names can be passed either CamelCased or under_scored (see example below).
    You can use the following types (capitalized or not):

        Date
        Integer
        Float
        Boolean
        Number
        String

Example:
    rails generate loco:model Article title content:string publishedAt:date

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/models/article.coffee
