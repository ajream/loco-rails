Description:
    Stubs out a new view. Pass the view name under_scored
    (as you would like to name the file) and an optional list of methods as arguments.

    To create a view within a namespace, specify the view name as a path
    like 'outer_namespace/inner_namespace/view_name'. It will also define necessary namespaces
    inside app/assets/javascripts/initializers/loco.coffee

    This generates a view class in app/assets/javascripts/views.

Example:
    rails generate loco:view admin/articles/form renderComments _renderComment

    This will create:
        app/assets/javascripts/views/admin/articles/form.coffee

    This will modify:
        app/assets/javascripts/initializers/loco.coffee
